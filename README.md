## SYNOPSIS

`dtrx [OPTIONS] ARCHIVE [ARCHIVE ...]`

## INSTALLATION

Copy [scripts/dtrx](scripts/dtrx) to a directory on PATH.

TODO- deploy to pypi to make it pip-installable!

## DESCRIPTION

dtrx extracts archives in a number of different formats; it currently
supports tar, zip (including self-extracting .exe files), cpio, rpm, deb,
gem, 7z, cab, rar, lzh, arj, and InstallShield files.  It can also decompress
files compressed with gzip, bzip2, lzma, xz, lrzip, lzip, or compress.

In addition to providing one command to handle many different archive
types, dtrx also aids the user by extracting contents consistently.  By
default, everything will be written to a dedicated directory that's named
after the archive.  dtrx will also change the permissions to ensure that the
owner can read and write all those files.

To run dtrx, simply call it with the archive(s) you wish to extract as
arguments.  For example::

   $ dtrx coreutils-5.*.tar.gz

You may specify URLs as arguments as well.  If you do, dtrx will use `wget
-c` to download the URL to the current directory and then extract what it
downloads.  This may fail if you already have a file in the current
directory with the same name as the file you're trying to download.

## OPTIONS

dtrx supports a number of options to mandate specific behavior:

```manpage
-r, --recursive
   With this option, dtrx will search inside the archives you specify to see
   if any of the contents are themselves archives, and extract those as
   well.

--one, --one-entry
   Normally, if an archive only contains one file or directory with a name
   that doesn't match the archive's, dtrx will ask you how to handle it.
   With this option, you can specify ahead of time what should happen.
   Possible values are:

   inside
      Extract the file/directory inside another directory named after the
      archive.  This is the default.

   rename
      Extract the file/directory in the current directory, and then rename
      it to match the name of the archive.

   here
      Extract the file/directory in the current directory.

-o, --overwrite
   Normally, dtrx will avoid extracting into a directory that already exists,
   and instead try to find an alternative name to use.  If this option is
   listed, dtrx will use the default directory name no matter what.

-f, --flat
   Extract all archive contents into the current directory, instead of
   their own dedicated directory.  This is handy if you have multiple
   archive files which all need to be extracted into the same directory
   structure.  Note that existing files may be overwritten with this
   option.

-n, --noninteractive
   dtrx will normally ask the user how to handle certain corner cases, such
   as how to handle an archive that only contains one file.  This option
   suppresses those questions; dtrx will instead use sane, conservative
   defaults.

-l, -t, --list, --table
   Don't extract the archives; just list their contents on standard output.

-m, --metadata
   Extract the metadata from .deb and .gem archives, instead of their normal
   contents.

-q, --quiet
   Suppress warning messages.  List this option twice to make dtrx silent.

-v, --verbose
   Show the files that are being extracted.  List this option twice to
   print debugging information.

--help
   Display basic help.

--version
   Display dtrx's version, copyright, and license information.
```

## TESTING

[tests/compare.py](tests/compare.py) is a script that loads
[tests/tests.yml](tests/tests.yml) and runs some tests on various archive
formats. To handle all the formats, a variety of tools need to be installed on
the test system. A Dockerfile is provided for convenience to test without
modifying the host system. To use the Dockerfile to run the tests, you might do:

```shell
# build the image
docker build -t "dtrx" -f Dockerfile --build-arg UID=$(id -u) .

# run tox in the container. note tox is being run serially (no -p auto), in case
# the working dir gets abused by the test script
docker run -v"$(pwd):/mnt/workspace" -t dtrx bash -c "cd /mnt/workspace && tox -s true"
```
